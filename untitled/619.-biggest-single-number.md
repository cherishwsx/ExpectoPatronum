# 619. Biggest Single Number

See original page [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/biggest-single-number/).

## Problem

Table `my_numbers` contains many numbers in column **num** including duplicated ones.  
Can you write a SQL query to find the biggest number, which only appears once.

```text
+---+
|num|
+---+
| 8 |
| 8 |
| 3 |
| 3 |
| 1 |
| 4 |
| 5 |
| 6 | 
```

For the sample data above, your query should return the following result:

```text
+---+
|num|
+---+
| 6 |
```

**Note:**  
If there is no such number, just output **null**.

## Solution

### Answer

```sql
SELECT MAX(num) AS num
FROM (
        SELECT num
        FROM my_numbers
        GROUP BY 1
        HAVING COUNT(*) = 1
    ) AS new;
```
