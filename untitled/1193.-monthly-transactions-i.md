# 1193. Monthly Transactions I

See original page [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/monthly-transactions-i/).

## Problem

Table: `Transactions`

```text
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| country       | varchar |
| state         | enum    |
| amount        | int     |
| trans_date    | date    |
+---------------+---------+
id is the primary key of this table.
The table has information about incoming transactions.
The state column is an enum of type ["approved", "declined"].
```

Write an SQL query to find for each month and country, the number of transactions and their total amount, the number of approved transactions and their total amount.

The query result format is in the following example:

```text
Transactions table:
+------+---------+----------+--------+------------+
| id   | country | state    | amount | trans_date |
+------+---------+----------+--------+------------+
| 121  | US      | approved | 1000   | 2018-12-18 |
| 122  | US      | declined | 2000   | 2018-12-19 |
| 123  | US      | approved | 2000   | 2019-01-01 |
| 124  | DE      | approved | 2000   | 2019-01-07 |
+------+---------+----------+--------+------------+

Result table:
+----------+---------+-------------+----------------+--------------------+-----------------------+
| month    | country | trans_count | approved_count | trans_total_amount | approved_total_amount |
+----------+---------+-------------+----------------+--------------------+-----------------------+
| 2018-12  | US      | 2           | 1              | 3000               | 1000                  |
| 2019-01  | US      | 1           | 1              | 2000               | 2000                  |
| 2019-01  | DE      | 1           | 1              | 2000               | 2000                  |
+----------+---------+-------------+----------------+--------------------+-----------------------+
```

## Solution

### Answer

```sql
select month, 
       Country, 
       count(*) as trans_count,
       count(case when state = 'approved' then id else null end) as approved_count,
       sum(amount) as trans_total_amount,
       sum(case when state = 'approved' then amount else 0 end) as approved_total_amount
from (
    select *, DATE_FORMAT(trans_date, '%Y-%m') as month
    from Transactions
) as new
group by 1,2
```
