# 608. Tree Node

See original page [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/tree-node/).

## Problem

Given a table `tree`, **id** is identifier of the tree node and **p\_id** is its parent node's **id**.

```text
+----+------+
| id | p_id |
+----+------+
| 1  | null |
| 2  | 1    |
| 3  | 1    |
| 4  | 2    |
| 5  | 2    |
+----+------+
```

Each node in the tree can be one of three types:

* Leaf: if the node is a leaf node.
* Root: if the node is the root of the tree.
* Inner: If the node is neither a leaf node nor a root node.

 Write a query to print the node id and the type of the node. Sort your output by the node id. The result for the above sample is:

```text
+----+------+
| id | Type |
+----+------+
| 1  | Root |
| 2  | Inner|
| 3  | Leaf |
| 4  | Leaf |
| 5  | Leaf |
+----+------+
```

**Explanation**

* Node '1' is root node, because its parent node is NULL and it has child node '2' and '3'.
* Node '2' is inner node, because it has parent node '1' and child node '4' and '5'.
* Node '3', '4' and '5' is Leaf node, because they have parent node and they don't have child node.
* And here is the image of the sample tree as below:

  ```text
  			           1
  			         /   \
                     2       3
                   /   \
                 4       5
  ```

  **Note**

  If there is only one node on the tree, you only need to output its root attributes.

## Solution

### Answer

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT t1.id, 
       CASE 
            WHEN t1.p_id IS NULL then 'Root'
            WHEN t2.id IS NOT NULL then 'Inner'
            WHEN t2.id IS NULL then 'Leaf'
       END AS Type 
FROM 
    tree AS t1 LEFT JOIN tree AS t2
    ON t1.id = t2.p_id
```
