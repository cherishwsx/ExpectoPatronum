# 175. Combine Two Tables

See original page [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/combine-two-tables/).

## Problem

Table: `Person`

```text
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| PersonId    | int     |
| FirstName   | varchar |
| LastName    | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
PersonId is the primary key column for this table.
```

Table: `Address`

```text
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| AddressId   | int     |
| PersonId    | int     |
| City        | varchar |
| State       | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
AddressId is the primary key column for this table.
```

Write a SQL query for a report that provides the following information for each person in the Person table, regardless if there is an address for each of those people:

```text
FirstName, LastName, City, State
```

## Solution

### Answer

```sql
SELECT p.FirstName, p.LastName, a.City, a.State 
FROM 
    Person AS p LEFT JOIN Address AS a
    ON p.PersonID = a.PersonID;
```
