# 185. Department Top Three Salaries

See original page [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/department-top-three-salaries/).

## Problem

The `Employee` table holds all employees. Every employee has an Id, and there is also a column for the department Id.

```text
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| Id | Name  | Salary | DepartmentId |
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| 1  | Joe   | 85000  | 1            |
| 2  | Henry | 80000  | 2            |
| 3  | Sam   | 60000  | 2            |
| 4  | Max   | 90000  | 1            |
| 5  | Janet | 69000  | 1            |
| 6  | Randy | 85000  | 1            |
| 7  | Will  | 70000  | 1            |
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
```

The `Department` table holds all departments of the company.

```text
+----+----------+
| Id | Name     |
+----+----------+
| 1  | IT       |
| 2  | Sales    |
+----+----------+
```

Write a SQL query to find employees who earn the top three salaries in each of the department. For the above tables, your SQL query should return the following rows \(order of rows does not matter\).

```text
+------------+----------+--------+
| Department | Employee | Salary |
+------------+----------+--------+
| IT         | Max      | 90000  |
| IT         | Randy    | 85000  |
| IT         | Joe      | 85000  |
| IT         | Will     | 70000  |
| Sales      | Henry    | 80000  |
| Sales      | Sam      | 60000  |
+------------+----------+--------+
```

**Explanation:**

In IT department, Max earns the highest salary, both Randy and Joe earn the second highest salary, and Will earns the third highest salary. There are only two employees in the Sales department, Henry earns the highest salary while Sam earns the second highest salary.

## Solution

### Detail

1. 因为在题目中已经说了每个人都有DepartmentId，所以这里left join和join是等同的。

### Answer

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="MS SQL Server" %}
```sql
WITH cte AS(
    SELECT *, DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY DepartmentID ORDER BY Salary DESC) as dr
    FROM Employee
)
SELECT d.Name AS Department, c.Name AS Employee, c.Salary AS Salary
FROM 
    cte AS c JOIN Department AS d
    ON c.DepartmentId = d.Id
WHERE c.dr <= 3;

```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}
