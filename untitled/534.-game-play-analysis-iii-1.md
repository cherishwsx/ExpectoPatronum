# 534. Game Play Analysis III

See original page [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/game-play-analysis-iii/).

## Problem

Table: `Activity`

```text
+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| player_id    | int     |
| device_id    | int     |
| event_date   | date    |
| games_played | int     |
+--------------+---------+
(player_id, event_date) is the primary key of this table.
This table shows the activity of players of some game.
Each row is a record of a player who logged in and played a number of games (possibly 0) before logging out on some day using some device.
```

Write an SQL query that reports for each player and date, how many games played **so far** by the player. That is, the total number of games played by the player until that date. Check the example for clarity.

The query result format is in the following example:

```text
Activity table:
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
| player_id | device_id | event_date | games_played |
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
| 1         | 2         | 2016-03-01 | 5            |
| 1         | 2         | 2016-05-02 | 6            |
| 1         | 3         | 2017-06-25 | 1            |
| 3         | 1         | 2016-03-02 | 0            |
| 3         | 4         | 2018-07-03 | 5            |
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+

Result table:
+-----------+------------+---------------------+
| player_id | event_date | games_played_so_far |
+-----------+------------+---------------------+
| 1         | 2016-03-01 | 5                   |
| 1         | 2016-05-02 | 11                  |
| 1         | 2017-06-25 | 12                  |
| 3         | 2016-03-02 | 0                   |
| 3         | 2018-07-03 | 5                   |
+-----------+------------+---------------------+
For the player with id 1, 5 + 6 = 11 games played by 2016-05-02, and 5 + 6 + 1 = 12 games played by 2017-06-25.
For the player with id 3, 0 + 5 = 5 games played by 2018-07-03.
Note that for each player we only care about the days when the player logged in.
```

## Solution

### New Points

1. 这是我目前为止最喜欢的一道题。
2. 按照条件来求Consecutive，实际上就是按照条件将表self join之后，使得要想加的部分有同样的key可以去group by。
3. 第二次写的一些感受：求consecutive sum的经典做法 self join加&gt;=condition
4. 窗口函数的聚合很有意思，详情看[这里](https://blog.csdn.net/richieruan/article/details/52712447)。
   1. range是逻辑窗口，算的是一个数字大小上的interval。
   2. row是物理窗口，按照表格上的行来滚动。

### Answer

Join

```sql
SELECT a1.player_id, a1.event_date, sum(a2.games_played) as games_played_so_far
FROM 
    Activity AS a1 LEFT JOIN Activity AS a2
    ON a1.player_id = a2.player_id AND a1.event_date >= a2.event_date
GROUP BY 1, 2;
```

Window Function

```sql
SELECT player_id, 
       event_date, 
       SUM(games_played) OVER(PARTITION BY player_id ORDER BY event_date asc ROWS BETWEEN unbounded preceding AND CURRENT ROW) AS games_played_so_far
FROM Activity;
```
