# 1127. User Purchase Platform

See original page [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/user-purchase-platform/).

## Problem

Table: `Spending`

```text
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| user_id     | int     |
| spend_date  | date    |
| platform    | enum    | 
| amount      | int     |
+-------------+---------+
The table logs the spendings history of users that make purchases from an online shopping website which has a desktop and a mobile application.
(user_id, spend_date, platform) is the primary key of this table.
The platform column is an ENUM type of ('desktop', 'mobile').
```

Write an SQL query to find the total number of users and the total amount spent using mobile **only**, desktop **only** and **both** mobile and desktop together for each date.

The query result format is in the following example:

```text
Spending table:
+---------+------------+----------+--------+
| user_id | spend_date | platform | amount |
+---------+------------+----------+--------+
| 1       | 2019-07-01 | mobile   | 100    |
| 1       | 2019-07-01 | desktop  | 100    |
| 2       | 2019-07-01 | mobile   | 100    |
| 2       | 2019-07-02 | mobile   | 100    |
| 3       | 2019-07-01 | desktop  | 100    |
| 3       | 2019-07-02 | desktop  | 100    |
+---------+------------+----------+--------+

Result table:
+------------+----------+--------------+-------------+
| spend_date | platform | total_amount | total_users |
+------------+----------+--------------+-------------+
| 2019-07-01 | desktop  | 100          | 1           |
| 2019-07-01 | mobile   | 100          | 1           |
| 2019-07-01 | both     | 200          | 1           |
| 2019-07-02 | desktop  | 100          | 1           |
| 2019-07-02 | mobile   | 100          | 1           |
| 2019-07-02 | both     | 0            | 0           |
+------------+----------+--------------+-------------+ 
On 2019-07-01, user 1 purchased using both desktop and mobile, user 2 purchased using mobile only and user 3 purchased using desktop only.
On 2019-07-02, user 2 purchased using mobile only, user 3 purchased using desktop only and no one purchased using both platforms.

### Answer

```sql
SELECT p.spend_date, 
       p.platform,
       IFNULL(SUM(t.amount), 0) AS total_amount,
       COUNT(user_id) AS total_users
FROM
    (
     SELECT DISTINCT(spend_date), 'desktop' platform FROM Spending
     UNION
     SELECT DISTINCT(spend_date), 'mobile' platform FROM Spending
     UNION
     SELECT DISTINCT(spend_date), 'both' platform FROM Spending
    ) AS p
    LEFT JOIN (
                SELECT spend_date, user_id,
                IF(mobile_amount > 0, IF(desktop_amount > 0, 'both', 'mobile'), 'desktop') AS platform,
                (mobile_amount + desktop_amount) AS amount
                FROM (
                        SELECT spend_date, user_id,
                        SUM(CASE WHEN platform = 'mobile' THEN amount ELSE 0 END) AS 'mobile_amount',
                        SUM(CASE WHEN platform = 'desktop' THEN amount ELSE 0 END) AS 'desktop_amount'
                        FROM Spending
                        GROUP BY 1, 2
                        ) AS o
                ) AS t
ON p.platform = t.platform AND p.spend_date=t.spend_date
GROUP BY 1,2;
