# 596. Classes More Than 5 Students

See original page [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/classes-more-than-5-students/).

## Problem

There is a table `courses` with columns: **student** and **class**

Please list out all classes which have more than or equal to 5 students.

For example, the table:

```text
+---------+------------+
| student | class      |
+---------+------------+
| A       | Math       |
| B       | English    |
| C       | Math       |
| D       | Biology    |
| E       | Math       |
| F       | Computer   |
| G       | Math       |
| H       | Math       |
| I       | Math       |
+---------+------------+
```

Should output:

```text
+---------+
| class   |
+---------+
| Math    |
+---------+
```
