# 601. Human Traffic of Stadium

See original page [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/human-traffic-of-stadium/).

## Problem

X city built a new stadium, each day many people visit it and the stats are saved as these columns: **id**, **visit\_date**, **people**

Please write a query to display the records which have 3 or more consecutive rows and the amount of people more than 100\(inclusive\).For example, the table `stadium`:

```text
+------+------------+-----------+
| id   | visit_date | people    |
+------+------------+-----------+
| 1    | 2017-01-01 | 10        |
| 2    | 2017-01-02 | 109       |
| 3    | 2017-01-03 | 150       |
| 4    | 2017-01-04 | 99        |
| 5    | 2017-01-05 | 145       |
| 6    | 2017-01-06 | 1455      |
| 7    | 2017-01-07 | 199       |
| 8    | 2017-01-08 | 188       |
+------+------------+-----------+
```

For the sample data above, the output is:

```text
+------+------------+-----------+
| id   | visit_date | people    |
+------+------------+-----------+
| 5    | 2017-01-05 | 145       |
| 6    | 2017-01-06 | 1455      |
| 7    | 2017-01-07 | 199       |
| 8    | 2017-01-08 | 188       |
+------+------------+-----------+
```

**Note:**  
Each day only have one row record, and the dates are increasing with id increasing.

## Solution

### Details

1. Since we want to find **at least 3 days** consecutive date, first in order to make sure we have 3 days consecutive, we should have 3 tables cross join. 
2. Then for the consecutive date that is over 3 days, we can think about the case that t1 is the first day, t1 is the second day and t1 is the third day.

### Answer

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT t1.*
FROM 
     stadium AS t1, stadium AS t2, stadium AS t3
WHERE
     t1.people >= 100 AND t2.people >= 100 AND t3.people >= 100 AND
    (
        (t1.id - t2.id = -1 AND t1.id - t3.id =-2 AND t2.id - t3.id = -1)  -- t1, t2, t3
        OR
        (t2.id - t1.id = -1 AND t2.id - t3.id = -2 AND t1.id - t3.id = -1) -- t2, t1, t3
        OR
        (t3.id - t2.id = -1 AND t2.id - t1.id = -1 AND t3.id - t1.id = -2) -- t3, t2, t1
    )
ORDER BY t1.id;
```
