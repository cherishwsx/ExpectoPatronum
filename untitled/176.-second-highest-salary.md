# 176. Second Highest Salary

See original page [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/second-highest-salary/).

## Problem

Write a SQL query to get the second highest salary from the `Employee` table.

```text
+----+--------+
| Id | Salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
```

For example, given the above Employee table, the query should return `200` as the second highest salary. If there is no second highest salary, then the query should return `null`.

```text
+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| 200                 |
+---------------------+
```

## Solution

### New Points

1. ifnull\(expression, value\) Mysql中适用，如果expression为null，那么就取value的值。详情看[这里](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_isnull.asp)。
2. limit m offset n Mysql中适用，意思是给出把前面n行去掉不算从第n+1行开始数m行的record。适用于找N大的值。
3. dense\_rank\(\) over\(\) 也可以使用，但是leetcode mysql版本过低。并且不强制搭配`PARTITION BY`使用

### Detail

1. 因为可能有重复的工资，所以排序要对distinct的工资来排，才能对应offset 1 limit 1

### Answer

```sql
SELECT (
    ifnull(
        (SELECT DISTINCT Salary FROM Employee
        ORDER BY Salary DESC
        LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1)
    , null)
) AS SecondHighestSalary;
```

Not sure why below doesn't work. When I came back to this question, I figured out why it does not work. It's because using CASE WHEN still can not handle the NULL perfectly. 

```sql
WITH cte AS(
    SELECT Salary, dense_rank() OVER(ORDER BY Salary DESC) AS rnk
    FROM Employee
)
SELECT CASE WHEN Salary != '' THEN Salary ELSE null END AS SecondHighestSalary 
FROM cte WHERE rnk = 2;
```

While `MAX()` can return NULL if there is an empty.

```sql
WITH cte AS(
    SELECT Salary, rank() OVER(ORDER BY Salary DESC) AS rnk
    FROM Employee
)
SELECT MAX(Salary) AS SecondHighestSalary 
FROM cte WHERE rnk = 2;
```
