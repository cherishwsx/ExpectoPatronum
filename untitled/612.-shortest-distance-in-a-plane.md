# 612. Shortest Distance in a Plane

See original page [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-distance-in-a-plane/).

## Problem

Table `point_2d` holds the coordinates \(x,y\) of some unique points \(more than two\) in a plane.

 Write a query to find the shortest distance between these points rounded to 2 decimals.

```text
| x  | y  |
|----|----|
| -1 | -1 |
| 0  | 0  |
| -1 | -2 |
```

 The shortest distance is 1.00 from point \(-1,-1\) to \(-1,2\). So the output should be:

```text
| shortest |
|----------|
| 1.00     |
```

 **Note:** The longest distance among all the points are less than 10000.

## Solution

### Details

1. Keep the record if there is one coordinate unequal.

### Answer

```text
SELECT ROUND(MIN(SQRT(POWER((p1.x - p2.x), 2) + POWER((p1.y - p2.y), 2))), 2) AS shortest
FROM point_2d AS p1, point_2d AS p2
WHERE p1.x != p2.x OR p1.y != p2.y;

```
