# 1077. Project Employees III

See original page [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/project-employees-iii/).

## Problem

Table: `Project`

```text
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| project_id  | int     |
| employee_id | int     |
+-------------+---------+
(project_id, employee_id) is the primary key of this table.
employee_id is a foreign key to Employee table.
```

Table: `Employee`

```text
+------------------+---------+
| Column Name      | Type    |
+------------------+---------+
| employee_id      | int     |
| name             | varchar |
| experience_years | int     |
+------------------+---------+
employee_id is the primary key of this table.
```

Write an SQL query that reports the **most experienced** employees in each project. In case of a tie, report all employees with the maximum number of experience years.

The query result format is in the following example:

```text
Project table:
+-------------+-------------+
| project_id  | employee_id |
+-------------+-------------+
| 1           | 1           |
| 1           | 2           |
| 1           | 3           |
| 2           | 1           |
| 2           | 4           |
+-------------+-------------+

Employee table:
+-------------+--------+------------------+
| employee_id | name   | experience_years |
+-------------+--------+------------------+
| 1           | Khaled | 3                |
| 2           | Ali    | 2                |
| 3           | John   | 3                |
| 4           | Doe    | 2                |
+-------------+--------+------------------+

Result table:
+-------------+---------------+
| project_id  | employee_id   |
+-------------+---------------+
| 1           | 1             |
| 1           | 3             |
| 2           | 1             |
+-------------+---------------+
Both employees with id 1 and 3 have the most experience among the employees of the first project. For the second project, the employee with id 1 has the most experience.
```

## Solution

### Details

1. Window function is much slower but for me it's more easier to understand.
2. If using subquery, then keep in mind that first thing is to find out how you want to the condition, if you want to find max under a partition, then basically the condition is the combo pair of the partition and its max that you want to find.

### Answer

Window Function

```sql
WITH CTE AS (
    SELECT p.project_id, 
           p.employee_id, 
           RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY p.project_id ORDER BY e.experience_years DESC) AS rnk
    FROM 
           Project AS p LEFT JOIN Employee AS e
           ON p.employee_id = e.employee_id
)
SELECT project_id, employee_id FROM CTE 
WHERE rnk = 1;
```

Subquery

```sql
SELECT p.project_id, p.employee_id
FROM 
     Project AS p LEFT JOIN Employee AS e
     ON p.employee_id = e.employee_id
WHERE (p.project_id, e.experience_years) IN 
      (
        SELECT project_id, MAX(experience_years) 
        FROM Project, Employee
        WHERE Project.employee_id = Employee.employee_id
        GROUP BY 1
      );
```
