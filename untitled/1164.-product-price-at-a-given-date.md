# 1164. Product Price at a Given Date

See original page [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/product-price-at-a-given-date/).

## Problem

Table: `Products`

```text
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| product_id    | int     |
| new_price     | int     |
| change_date   | date    |
+---------------+---------+
(product_id, change_date) is the primary key of this table.
Each row of this table indicates that the price of some product was changed to a new price at some date.
```

Write an SQL query to find the prices of all products on **2019-08-16**. Assume the price of all products before any change is **10**.

The query result format is in the following example:

```text
Products table:
+------------+-----------+-------------+
| product_id | new_price | change_date |
+------------+-----------+-------------+
| 1          | 20        | 2019-08-14  |
| 2          | 50        | 2019-08-14  |
| 1          | 30        | 2019-08-15  |
| 1          | 35        | 2019-08-16  |
| 2          | 65        | 2019-08-17  |
| 3          | 20        | 2019-08-18  |
+------------+-----------+-------------+

Result table:
+------------+-------+
| product_id | price |
+------------+-------+
| 2          | 50    |
| 1          | 35    |
| 3          | 10    |
+------------+-------+
```

## Solution

### Answer

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT o.product_id,
       CASE WHEN l.new_price IS NOT NULL then l.new_price ELSE 10 END AS price
FROM (
        SELECT DISTINCT product_id
        FROM Products
      ) AS o LEFT JOIN (
                            SELECT product_id, new_price
                            FROM Products
                            WHERE (product_id, change_date) IN (
                                                                   SELECT product_id, MAX(change_date) AS latest
                                                                   FROM Products
                                                                   WHERE change_date <= '2019-08-16'
                                                                   GROUP BY 1
                                                                )
                            ) AS l
       ON o.product_id = l.product_id;
```
