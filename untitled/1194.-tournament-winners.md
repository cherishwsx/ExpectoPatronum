# 1194. Tournament Winners

See original page [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/tournament-winners/).

## Problem

Table: `Players`

```text
+-------------+-------+
| Column Name | Type  |
+-------------+-------+
| player_id   | int   |
| group_id    | int   |
+-------------+-------+
player_id is the primary key of this table.
Each row of this table indicates the group of each player.
```

Table: `Matches`

```text
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| match_id      | int     |
| first_player  | int     |
| second_player | int     | 
| first_score   | int     |
| second_score  | int     |
+---------------+---------+
match_id is the primary key of this table.
Each row is a record of a match, first_player and second_player contain the player_id of each match.
first_score and second_score contain the number of points of the first_player and second_player respectively.
You may assume that, in each match, players belongs to the same group.
```

The winner in each group is the player who scored the maximum total points within the group. In the case of a tie, the **lowest** player\_id wins.

Write an SQL query to find the winner in each group.

The query result format is in the following example:

```text
Players table:
+-----------+------------+
| player_id | group_id   |
+-----------+------------+
| 15        | 1          |
| 25        | 1          |
| 30        | 1          |
| 45        | 1          |
| 10        | 2          |
| 35        | 2          |
| 50        | 2          |
| 20        | 3          |
| 40        | 3          |
+-----------+------------+

Matches table:
+------------+--------------+---------------+-------------+--------------+
| match_id   | first_player | second_player | first_score | second_score |
+------------+--------------+---------------+-------------+--------------+
| 1          | 15           | 45            | 3           | 0            |
| 2          | 30           | 25            | 1           | 2            |
| 3          | 30           | 15            | 2           | 0            |
| 4          | 40           | 20            | 5           | 2            |
| 5          | 35           | 50            | 1           | 1            |
+------------+--------------+---------------+-------------+--------------+

Result table:
+-----------+------------+
| group_id  | player_id  |
+-----------+------------+ 
| 1         | 15         |
| 2         | 35         |
| 3         | 40         |
+-----------+------------+
```

## Solution

### Answer

{% code title="MS SQL" %}
```sql
with total_score as (
    select player_id, sum(score) as score from (
        select first_player as player_id, first_score as score from Matches 
        union all
        select second_player as player_id, second_score as score from Matches
    ) as new
    group by player_id
), ranking as (
    select p.group_id, p.player_id,
           row_number() over(partition by p.group_id order by t.score desc, t.player_id asc) as rnk
    from Players as p left join total_score as t
    on p.player_id = t.player_id
)
select group_id, player_id from ranking
where rnk = 1
order by 1,2;
```
{% endcode %}
