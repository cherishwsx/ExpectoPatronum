# 603. Consecutive Available Seats

See original page [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/consecutive-available-seats/).

## Problem

Several friends at a cinema ticket office would like to reserve consecutive available seats.  
Can you help to query all the consecutive available seats order by the seat\_id using the following `cinema` table?

```text
| seat_id | free |
|---------|------|
| 1       | 1    |
| 2       | 0    |
| 3       | 1    |
| 4       | 1    |
| 5       | 1    |
```

 Your query should return the following result for the sample case above.

```text
| seat_id |
|---------|
| 3       |
| 4       |
| 5       |
```

**Note**:

* The seat\_id is an auto increment int, and free is bool \('1' means free, and '0' means occupied.\).
* Consecutive available seats are more than 2\(inclusive\) seats consecutively available.

## Solution

### Details

1. 我觉得这道题应该在601前面。

### Answer

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT t1.seat_id
FROM cinema AS t1, cinema AS t2
WHERE 
     t1.free = 1 AND t2.free = 1 AND
     ((t1.seat_id + 1 = t2.seat_id) OR
     (t1.seat_id - 1 = t2.seat_id));
```
