# 626. Exchange Seats

See original page [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/exchange-seats/).

## Problem

Mary is a teacher in a middle school and she has a table `seat` storing students' names and their corresponding seat ids.The column **id** is continuous increment.

 Mary wants to change seats for the adjacent students.

 Can you write a SQL query to output the result for Mary?

```text
+---------+---------+
|    id   | student |
+---------+---------+
|    1    | Abbot   |
|    2    | Doris   |
|    3    | Emerson |
|    4    | Green   |
|    5    | Jeames  |
+---------+---------+
```

For the sample input, the output is:

```text
+---------+---------+
|    id   | student |
+---------+---------+
|    1    | Doris   |
|    2    | Abbot   |
|    3    | Green   |
|    4    | Emerson |
|    5    | Jeames  |
+---------+---------+
```

**Note:**  
If the number of students is odd, there is no need to change the last one's seat.

## Solution

### Details

1. 我觉得是个好题，因为我做了两遍还是不是很会...
2. You can use case when when you are joining tables.
3. Check out the `COALESCE` [here](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/func_mysql_coalesce.asp).

### Answer

```sql
SELECT a.id, 
       COALESCE(b.student, a.student) AS student
FROM 
     seat a LEFT JOIN seat b
     ON a.id = (
                    CASE WHEN b.id % 2 != 0 THEN b.id + 1
                    ELSE b.id - 1
                    END
                )
ORDER BY a.id;
```
