# 1173. Immediate Food Delivery I

See original page [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/immediate-food-delivery-i/).

## Problem

Table: `Delivery`

```text
+-----------------------------+---------+
| Column Name                 | Type    |
+-----------------------------+---------+
| delivery_id                 | int     |
| customer_id                 | int     |
| order_date                  | date    |
| customer_pref_delivery_date | date    |
+-----------------------------+---------+
delivery_id is the primary key of this table.
The table holds information about food delivery to customers that make orders at some date and specify a preferred delivery date (on the same order date or after it).
```

If the preferred delivery date of the customer is the same as the order date then the order is called _immediate_ otherwise it's called _scheduled_.

Write an SQL query to find the percentage of immediate orders in the table, **rounded to 2 decimal places**.

The query result format is in the following example:

```text
Delivery table:
+-------------+-------------+------------+-----------------------------+
| delivery_id | customer_id | order_date | customer_pref_delivery_date |
+-------------+-------------+------------+-----------------------------+
| 1           | 1           | 2019-08-01 | 2019-08-02                  |
| 2           | 5           | 2019-08-02 | 2019-08-02                  |
| 3           | 1           | 2019-08-11 | 2019-08-11                  |
| 4           | 3           | 2019-08-24 | 2019-08-26                  |
| 5           | 4           | 2019-08-21 | 2019-08-22                  |
| 6           | 2           | 2019-08-11 | 2019-08-13                  |
+-------------+-------------+------------+-----------------------------+

Result table:
+----------------------+
| immediate_percentage |
+----------------------+
| 33.33                |
+----------------------+
The orders with delivery id 2 and 3 are immediate while the others are scheduled.
```

## Solution

### Answer

```sql
SELECT ROUND(100 * COUNT(CASE WHEN order_date = customer_pref_delivery_date THEN customer_id ELSE NULL END) / COUNT(*), 2) AS immediate_percentage
FROM Delivery;
```
