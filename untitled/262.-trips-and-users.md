# 262. Trips and Users

See original page [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/trips-and-users/).

## Problem

The `Trips` table holds all taxi trips. Each trip has a unique Id, while Client\_Id and Driver\_Id are both foreign keys to the Users\_Id at the `Users` table. Status is an ENUM type of \(‘completed’, ‘cancelled\_by\_driver’, ‘cancelled\_by\_client’\).

```text
+----+-----------+-----------+---------+--------------------+----------+
| Id | Client_Id | Driver_Id | City_Id |        Status      |Request_at|
+----+-----------+-----------+---------+--------------------+----------+
| 1  |     1     |    10     |    1    |     completed      |2013-10-01|
| 2  |     2     |    11     |    1    | cancelled_by_driver|2013-10-01|
| 3  |     3     |    12     |    6    |     completed      |2013-10-01|
| 4  |     4     |    13     |    6    | cancelled_by_client|2013-10-01|
| 5  |     1     |    10     |    1    |     completed      |2013-10-02|
| 6  |     2     |    11     |    6    |     completed      |2013-10-02|
| 7  |     3     |    12     |    6    |     completed      |2013-10-02|
| 8  |     2     |    12     |    12   |     completed      |2013-10-03|
| 9  |     3     |    10     |    12   |     completed      |2013-10-03| 
| 10 |     4     |    13     |    12   | cancelled_by_driver|2013-10-03|
+----+-----------+-----------+---------+--------------------+----------+
```

The `Users` table holds all users. Each user has an unique Users\_Id, and Role is an ENUM type of \(‘client’, ‘driver’, ‘partner’\).

```text
+----------+--------+--------+
| Users_Id | Banned |  Role  |
+----------+--------+--------+
|    1     |   No   | client |
|    2     |   Yes  | client |
|    3     |   No   | client |
|    4     |   No   | client |
|    10    |   No   | driver |
|    11    |   No   | driver |
|    12    |   No   | driver |
|    13    |   No   | driver |
+----------+--------+--------+
```

Write a SQL query to find the cancellation rate of requests made by unbanned users \(both client and driver must be unbanned\) between **Oct 1, 2013** and **Oct 3, 2013**. The cancellation rate is computed by dividing the number of canceled \(by client or driver\) requests made by unbanned users by the total number of requests made by unbanned users.

For the above tables, your SQL query should return the following rows with the cancellation rate being rounded to _two_ decimal places.

```text
+------------+-------------------+
|     Day    | Cancellation Rate |
+------------+-------------------+
| 2013-10-01 |       0.33        |
| 2013-10-02 |       0.00        |
| 2013-10-03 |       0.50        |
+------------+-------------------+
```

## Solution

### Details

1. Aggregation + Case When很棒
2. Pattern Match的符号%是任意，\_是单一。

### Answer

Subquery:

```sql
SELECT Request_at AS 'Day',
       ROUND(COUNT(CASE WHEN Status LIKE 'cancelled%' THEN Status ELSE NULL END) / COUNT(*), 2) AS 'Cancellation Rate'
FROM Trips
WHERE
     Client_Id NOT IN (
                        SELECT Users_Id from Users
                        WHERE Banned = 'Yes'
                            )
     AND                       
     Request_at <= '2013-10-03' AND Request_at >= '2013-10-01'
GROUP BY Request_at;
```

Join:

```sql
SELECT t.Request_at AS 'Day',
       ROUND(COUNT(CASE WHEN t.Status LIKE 'cancelled%' THEN t.Status ELSE NULL END) / COUNT(*), 2) AS 'Cancellation Rate'
FROM 
     Trips AS t LEFT JOIN Users AS u
     ON t.Client_Id = u.Users_Id
WHERE 
     u.Banned = 'No' 
     AND 
     t.Request_at <= '2013-10-03' AND t.Request_at >= '2013-10-01'
GROUP BY 1;
```
