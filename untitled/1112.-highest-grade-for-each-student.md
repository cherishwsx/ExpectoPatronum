# 1112. Highest Grade For Each Student

See original page [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/highest-grade-for-each-student/).

## Problem

Table: `Enrollments`

```text
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| student_id    | int     |
| course_id     | int     |
| grade         | int     |
+---------------+---------+
(student_id, course_id) is the primary key of this table.

```

Write a SQL query to find the highest grade with its corresponding course for each student. In case of a tie, you should find the course with the smallest `course_id`. The output must be sorted by increasing `student_id`.

The query result format is in the following example:

```text
Enrollments table:
+------------+-------------------+
| student_id | course_id | grade |
+------------+-----------+-------+
| 2          | 2         | 95    |
| 2          | 3         | 95    |
| 1          | 1         | 90    |
| 1          | 2         | 99    |
| 3          | 1         | 80    |
| 3          | 2         | 75    |
| 3          | 3         | 82    |
+------------+-----------+-------+

Result table:
+------------+-------------------+
| student_id | course_id | grade |
+------------+-----------+-------+
| 1          | 2         | 99    |
| 2          | 2         | 95    |
| 3          | 3         | 82    |
+------------+-----------+-------+
```

## Solution

### Answer

```sql
SELECT student_id, MIN(course_id) AS course_id, grade
FROM Enrollments
WHERE (student_id, grade) IN (
                                SELECT student_id, MAX(grade) AS max_grade
                                FROM Enrollments
                                GROUP BY 1
                              )
GROUP BY student_id;

```
