# 1141. User Activity for the Past 30 Days I

See original page [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/user-activity-for-the-past-30-days-i/).

## Problem

Table: `Activity`

```text
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| user_id       | int     |
| session_id    | int     |
| activity_date | date    |
| activity_type | enum    |
+---------------+---------+
There is no primary key for this table, it may have duplicate rows.
The activity_type column is an ENUM of type ('open_session', 'end_session', 'scroll_down', 'send_message').
The table shows the user activities for a social media website. 
Note that each session belongs to exactly one user.
```

Write an SQL query to find the daily active user count for a period of 30 days ending **2019-07-27** inclusively. A user was active on some day if he/she made at least one activity on that day.

The query result format is in the following example:

```text
Activity table:
+---------+------------+---------------+---------------+
| user_id | session_id | activity_date | activity_type |
+---------+------------+---------------+---------------+
| 1       | 1          | 2019-07-20    | open_session  |
| 1       | 1          | 2019-07-20    | scroll_down   |
| 1       | 1          | 2019-07-20    | end_session   |
| 2       | 4          | 2019-07-20    | open_session  |
| 2       | 4          | 2019-07-21    | send_message  |
| 2       | 4          | 2019-07-21    | end_session   |
| 3       | 2          | 2019-07-21    | open_session  |
| 3       | 2          | 2019-07-21    | send_message  |
| 3       | 2          | 2019-07-21    | end_session   |
| 4       | 3          | 2019-06-25    | open_session  |
| 4       | 3          | 2019-06-25    | end_session   |
+---------+------------+---------------+---------------+

Result table:
+------------+--------------+ 
| day        | active_users |
+------------+--------------+ 
| 2019-07-20 | 2            |
| 2019-07-21 | 2            |
+------------+--------------+ 
Note that we do not care about days with zero active users.
```

## Solution

### Answer

```sql
SELECT activity_date AS day, COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) as active_users
FROM Activity
WHERE DATEDIFF('2019-07-27', activity_date) < 30
GROUP BY 1
HAVING COUNT(activity_type) >= 1;
```
