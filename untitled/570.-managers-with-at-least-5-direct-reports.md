# 570. Managers with at Least 5 Direct Reports

See original page [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/managers-with-at-least-5-direct-reports/).

## Problem

The `Employee` table holds all employees including their managers. Every employee has an Id, and there is also a column for the manager Id.

```text
+------+----------+-----------+----------+
|Id    |Name 	  |Department |ManagerId |
+------+----------+-----------+----------+
|101   |John 	  |A 	      |null      |
|102   |Dan 	  |A 	      |101       |
|103   |James 	  |A 	      |101       |
|104   |Amy 	  |A 	      |101       |
|105   |Anne 	  |A 	      |101       |
|106   |Ron 	  |B 	      |101       |
+------+----------+-----------+----------+
```

Given the `Employee` table, write a SQL query that finds out managers with at least 5 direct report. For the above table, your SQL query should return:

```text
+-------+
| Name  |
+-------+
| John  |
+-------+
```

**Note:**  
No one would report to himself.

## Solution

### Answer

```sql
SELECT e1.Name as Name
FROM 
    Employee AS e1 LEFT JOIN Employee AS e2
    ON e1.Id = e2.ManagerId
GROUP BY 1
HAVING COUNT(e2.Name) >= 5;
```
