# 1045. Customers Who Bought All Products

See original page [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/customers-who-bought-all-products/).

## Problem

Table: `Customer`

```text
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| customer_id | int     |
| product_key | int     |
+-------------+---------+
product_key is a foreign key to Product table.
```

Table: `Product`

```text
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| product_key | int     |
+-------------+---------+
product_key is the primary key column for this table.
```

Write an SQL query for a report that provides the customer ids from the `Customer` table that bought all the products in the `Product` table.

For example:

```text
Customer table:
+-------------+-------------+
| customer_id | product_key |
+-------------+-------------+
| 1           | 5           |
| 2           | 6           |
| 3           | 5           |
| 3           | 6           |
| 1           | 6           |
+-------------+-------------+

Product table:
+-------------+
| product_key |
+-------------+
| 5           |
| 6           |
+-------------+

Result table:
+-------------+
| customer_id |
+-------------+
| 1           |
| 3           |
+-------------+
The customers who bought all the products (5 and 6) are customers with id 1 and 3.
```

## Solution

### Answer

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT customer_id
FROM Customer
GROUP BY 1
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT product_key) = (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Product);
```
