# 580. Count Student Number in Departments

See original page [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-student-number-in-departments/).

## Problem

A university uses 2 data tables, **student** and **department**, to store data about its students and the departments associated with each major.

Write a query to print the respective department name and number of students majoring in each department for all departments in the **department** table \(even ones with no current students\).

Sort your results by descending number of students; if two or more departments have the same number of students, then sort those departments alphabetically by department name.

The **student** is described as follow:

```text
| Column Name  | Type      |
|--------------|-----------|
| student_id   | Integer   |
| student_name | String    |
| gender       | Character |
| dept_id      | Integer   |
```

where student\_id is the student's ID number, student\_name is the student's name, gender is their gender, and dept\_id is the department ID associated with their declared major.

And the **department** table is described as below:

```text
| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| dept_id     | Integer |
| dept_name   | String  |
```

where dept\_id is the department's ID number and dept\_name is the department name.

Here is an example **input**:  
**student** table:

```text
| student_id | student_name | gender | dept_id |
|------------|--------------|--------|---------|
| 1          | Jack         | M      | 1       |
| 2          | Jane         | F      | 1       |
| 3          | Mark         | M      | 2       |
```

**department** table:

```text
| dept_id | dept_name   |
|---------|-------------|
| 1       | Engineering |
| 2       | Science     |
| 3       | Law         |
```

The **Output** should be:

```text
| dept_name   | student_number |
|-------------|----------------|
| Engineering | 2              |
| Science     | 1              |
| Law         | 0              |
```

## Solution

### Answer

```sql
SELECT d.dept_name,
       IFNULL(COUNT(s.student_id), 0) AS student_number
FROM 
    department AS d LEFT JOIN student AS s
    ON d.dept_id = s.dept_id
GROUP BY d.dept_name
ORDER BY student_number DESC, 
         d.dept_name;
```
