# 181. Employees Earning More Than Their Managers

See original page [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/employees-earning-more-than-their-managers/).

## Problem

The `Employee` table holds all employees including their managers. Every employee has an Id, and there is also a column for the manager Id.

```text
+----+-------+--------+-----------+
| Id | Name  | Salary | ManagerId |
+----+-------+--------+-----------+
| 1  | Joe   | 70000  | 3         |
| 2  | Henry | 80000  | 4         |
| 3  | Sam   | 60000  | NULL      |
| 4  | Max   | 90000  | NULL      |
+----+-------+--------+-----------+
```

Given the `Employee` table, write a SQL query that finds out employees who earn more than their managers. For the above table, Joe is the only employee who earns more than his manager.

```text
+----------+
| Employee |
+----------+
| Joe      |
+----------+
```

## Solution

```sql
SELECT e1.Name AS Employee
FROM 
    Employee e1 LEFT JOIN Employee e2
    ON e1.ManagerId = e2.Id
WHERE e1.Salary > e2.Salary;
```
