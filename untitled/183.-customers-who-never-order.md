# 183. Customers Who Never Order

See original page [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/customers-who-never-order/).

## Problem

Suppose that a website contains two tables, the `Customers` table and the `Orders` table. Write a SQL query to find all customers who never order anything.

Table: `Customers`.

```text
+----+-------+
| Id | Name  |
+----+-------+
| 1  | Joe   |
| 2  | Henry |
| 3  | Sam   |
| 4  | Max   |
+----+-------+
```

Table: `Orders`.

```text
+----+------------+
| Id | CustomerId |
+----+------------+
| 1  | 3          |
| 2  | 1          |
+----+------------+
```

Using the above tables as example, return the following:

```text
+-----------+
| Customers |
+-----------+
| Henry     |
| Max       |
+-----------+
```

## Solution

```sql
SELECT c.Name AS Customers
FROM 
    Customers c LEFT JOIN Orders o
    ON c.Id = o.CustomerId
WHERE o.Id IS NULL;
```
