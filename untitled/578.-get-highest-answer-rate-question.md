# 578. Get Highest Answer Rate Question

See original page [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/get-highest-answer-rate-question/).

## Problem

Get the highest answer rate question from a table `survey_log` with these columns: **uid**, **action**, **question\_id**, **answer\_id**, **q\_num**, **timestamp**.

uid means user id; action has these kind of values: "show", "answer", "skip"; answer\_id is not null when action column is "answer", while is null for "show" and "skip"; q\_num is the numeral order of the question in current session.

Write a sql query to identify the question which has the highest answer rate.

**Example:**

```text
Input:
+------+-----------+--------------+------------+-----------+------------+
| uid  | action    | question_id  | answer_id  | q_num     | timestamp  |
+------+-----------+--------------+------------+-----------+------------+
| 5    | show      | 285          | null       | 1         | 123        |
| 5    | answer    | 285          | 124124     | 1         | 124        |
| 5    | show      | 369          | null       | 2         | 125        |
| 5    | skip      | 369          | null       | 2         | 126        |
+------+-----------+--------------+------------+-----------+------------+
Output:
+-------------+
| survey_log  |
+-------------+
|    285      |
+-------------+
Explanation:
question 285 has answer rate 1/1, while question 369 has 0/1 answer rate, so output 285.
```

**Note:** The highest answer rate meaning is: answer number's ratio in show number in the same question.  


## Solution

### Details

1. I think this question is wrong.... 
2. The solution only returns the first row after ordering but what if there is a tie? 

```sql
SELECT question_id AS survey_log
FROM (
    SELECT question_id, 
           COUNT(CASE WHEN action = 'answer' THEN action ELSE NULL END) /
           COUNT(DISTINCT question_id) AS rate
    FROM survey_log
    GROUP BY 1
) AS new
ORDER BY rate DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

### Answer

I think this answer using the window function is more solid. 

```sql
WITH rating AS (
    SELECT question_id, 
           COUNT(CASE WHEN action = 'answer' THEN action ELSE NULL END) /
           COUNT(DISTINCT question_id) AS rate
    FROM survey_log
    GROUP BY question_id
), rnk AS (
    SELECT question_id, RANK() OVER(ORDER BY rate DESC) as ranking
    FROM rating
)
SELECT question_id AS survey_log
FROM rnk
WHERE ranking = 1;
```
