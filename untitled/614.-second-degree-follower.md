# 614. Second Degree Follower

See original page [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/second-degree-follower/).

## Problem

In facebook, there is a `follow` table with two columns: **followee**, **follower**.

Please write a sql query to get the amount of each followerâ€™s follower if he/she has one.

For example:

```text
+-------------+------------+
| followee    | follower   |
+-------------+------------+
|     A       |     B      |
|     B       |     C      |
|     B       |     D      |
|     D       |     E      |
+-------------+------------+
```

should output:

```text
+-------------+------------+
| follower    | num        |
+-------------+------------+
|     B       |  2         |
|     D       |  1         |
+-------------+------------+
```

**Explaination:**  
Both B and D exist in the follower list, when as a followee, B's follower is C and D, and D's follower is E. A does not exist in follower list.

 **Note:**  
Followee would not follow himself/herself in all cases.  
Please display the result in follower's alphabet order.

## Solution

### Details

1. I think left join is also fine depends on if the requirement wants the user with 0 second follower or not.

### Answer

```sql
SELECT f1.follower AS follower, COUNT(DISTINCT f2.follower) AS num
FROM 
    follow AS f1 JOIN follow AS f2
    ON f1.follower = f2.followee
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;
```
