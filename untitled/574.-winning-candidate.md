# 574. Winning Candidate

See original page [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/winning-candidate/).

## Problem

Table: `Candidate`

```text
+-----+---------+
| id  | Name    |
+-----+---------+
| 1   | A       |
| 2   | B       |
| 3   | C       |
| 4   | D       |
| 5   | E       |
+-----+---------+  
```

Table: `Vote`

```text
+-----+--------------+
| id  | CandidateId  |
+-----+--------------+
| 1   |     2        |
| 2   |     4        |
| 3   |     3        |
| 4   |     2        |
| 5   |     5        |
+-----+--------------+
id is the auto-increment primary key,
CandidateId is the id appeared in Candidate table.
```

Write a sql to find the name of the winning candidate, the above example will return the winner `B`.

```text
+------+
| Name |
+------+
| B    |
+------+
```

## Solution

### Details

1. Answer below is not correct since if you are doing join and return the first row, you will always get an output even though the `Vote` table is empty. But using the subquery to first find out the winning id in  `Vote` table is a better choice.

```sql
SELECT c.Name AS Name
FROM 
    Candidate AS c LEFT JOIN (
                                SELECT CandidateId, COUNT(*) AS num FROM Vote
                                GROUP BY 1
                              ) AS v
    ON c.id = v.CandidateId
ORDER BY v.num DESC
LIMIT 1;

```

### Answer

```sql
SELECT Name AS Name
FROM Candidate
WHERE id = (
                SELECT CandidateId 
                FROM Vote
                GROUP BY 1
                ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
                LIMIT 1
            )
```
