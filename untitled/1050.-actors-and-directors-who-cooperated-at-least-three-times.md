# 1050. Actors and Directors Who Cooperated At Least Three Times

See original page [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/actors-and-directors-who-cooperated-at-least-three-times/).

## Problem

Table: `ActorDirector`

```text
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| actor_id    | int     |
| director_id | int     |
| timestamp   | int     |
+-------------+---------+
timestamp is the primary key column for this table.
```

Write a SQL query for a report that provides the pairs `(actor_id, director_id)` where the actor have cooperated with the director at least 3 times.

**Example:**

```text
ActorDirector table:
+-------------+-------------+-------------+
| actor_id    | director_id | timestamp   |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+
| 1           | 1           | 0           |
| 1           | 1           | 1           |
| 1           | 1           | 2           |
| 1           | 2           | 3           |
| 1           | 2           | 4           |
| 2           | 1           | 5           |
| 2           | 1           | 6           |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+

Result table:
+-------------+-------------+
| actor_id    | director_id |
+-------------+-------------+
| 1           | 1           |
+-------------+-------------+
The only pair is (1, 1) where they cooperated exactly 3 times.
```

## Solution

### Answer

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT actor_id, director_id
FROM ActorDirector
GROUP BY 1, 2
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 3;
```
