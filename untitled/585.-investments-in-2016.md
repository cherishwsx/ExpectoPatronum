# 585. Investments in 2016

See original page [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/investments-in-2016/).

## Problem

Write a query to print the sum of all total investment values in 2016 \(**TIV\_2016**\), to a scale of 2 decimal places, for all policy holders who meet the following criteria:

1. Have the same **TIV\_2015** value as one or more other policyholders.
2. Are not located in the same city as any other policyholder \(i.e.: the \(latitude, longitude\) attribute pairs must be unique\).

**Input Format:**  
The **insurance** table is described as follows:

```text
| Column Name | Type          |
|-------------|---------------|
| PID         | INTEGER(11)   |
| TIV_2015    | NUMERIC(15,2) |
| TIV_2016    | NUMERIC(15,2) |
| LAT         | NUMERIC(5,2)  |
| LON         | NUMERIC(5,2)  |
```

where **PID** is the policyholder's policy ID, **TIV\_2015** is the total investment value in 2015, **TIV\_2016** is the total investment value in 2016, **LAT** is the latitude of the policy holder's city, and **LON** is the longitude of the policy holder's city.

**Sample Input**

```text
| PID | TIV_2015 | TIV_2016 | LAT | LON |
|-----|----------|----------|-----|-----|
| 1   | 10       | 5        | 10  | 10  |
| 2   | 20       | 20       | 20  | 20  |
| 3   | 10       | 30       | 20  | 20  |
| 4   | 10       | 40       | 40  | 40  |
```

**Sample Output**

```text
| TIV_2016 |
|----------|
| 45.00    |
```

**Explanation**

```text
The first record in the table, like the last record, meets both of the two criteria.
The TIV_2015 value '10' is as the same as the third and forth record, and its location unique.

The second record does not meet any of the two criteria. Its TIV_2015 is not like any other policyholders.

And its location is the same with the third record, which makes the third record fail, too.

So, the result is the sum of TIV_2016 of the first and last record, which is 45.
```

## Solution

### Answer

```sql
SELECT ROUND(SUM(TIV_2016), 2) AS TIV_2016
FROM insurance
WHERE (LAT, LON) IN (
                        SELECT LAT, LON 
                        FROM insurance 
                        GROUP BY 1,2 
                        HAVING COUNT(*) = 1
                    )
       AND
       TIV_2015 IN (
                        SELECT TIV_2015
                        FROM insurance
                        GROUP BY 1
                        HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
                    );
```
