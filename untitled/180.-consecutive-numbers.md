# 180. Consecutive Numbers

See original page [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/consecutive-numbers/).

## Problem

Write a SQL query to find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively.

```text
+----+-----+
| Id | Num |
+----+-----+
| 1  |  1  |
| 2  |  1  |
| 3  |  1  |
| 4  |  2  |
| 5  |  1  |
| 6  |  2  |
| 7  |  2  |
+----+-----+
```

For example, given the above `Logs`table, `1` is the only number that appears consecutively for at least three times.

```text
+-----------------+
| ConsecutiveNums |
+-----------------+
| 1               |
+-----------------+
```

## Solution

### Details

1. 要找连续的数字或者连续的日期，需要找连续多少个就self join几个table。比如至少连续三天，就连三个table。
2. 并且要distinct！

### Answer

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT l1.Num AS ConsecutiveNums
FROM 
    Logs AS l1 LEFT JOIN Logs AS l2 
    ON l1.Num = l2.Num
    LEFT JOIN Logs AS l3
    ON l2.Num = l3.Num 
WHERE l1.Id + 1 = l2.Id AND l2.Id + 1 = l3.Id;
```

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT a.Num AS ConsecutiveNums
FROM Logs AS a, Logs AS b, Logs AS c
WHERE a.id = b.id - 1 AND b.id = c.id - 1 AND
      a.Num = b.Num AND b.Num = c.Num;
```
