# 607. Sales Person

See original page [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/sales-person/).

## Problem

**Description**

Given three tables: `salesperson`, `company`, `orders`.  
Output all the **names** in the table `salesperson`, who didnâ€™t have sales to company 'RED'.

**Example**  
**Input**

Table: `salesperson`

```text
+----------+------+--------+-----------------+-----------+
| sales_id | name | salary | commission_rate | hire_date |
+----------+------+--------+-----------------+-----------+
|   1      | John | 100000 |     6           | 4/1/2006  |
|   2      | Amy  | 120000 |     5           | 5/1/2010  |
|   3      | Mark | 65000  |     12          | 12/25/2008|
|   4      | Pam  | 25000  |     25          | 1/1/2005  |
|   5      | Alex | 50000  |     10          | 2/3/2007  |
+----------+------+--------+-----------------+-----------+
```

The table `salesperson` holds the salesperson information. Every salesperson has a **sales\_id** and a **name**.

Table: `company`

```text
+---------+--------+------------+
| com_id  |  name  |    city    |
+---------+--------+------------+
|   1     |  RED   |   Boston   |
|   2     | ORANGE |   New York |
|   3     | YELLOW |   Boston   |
|   4     | GREEN  |   Austin   |
+---------+--------+------------+
```

The table `company` holds the company information. Every company has a **com\_id** and a **name**.

Table: `orders`

```text
+----------+------------+---------+----------+--------+
| order_id | order_date | com_id  | sales_id | amount |
+----------+------------+---------+----------+--------+
| 1        |   1/1/2014 |    3    |    4     | 100000 |
| 2        |   2/1/2014 |    4    |    5     | 5000   |
| 3        |   3/1/2014 |    1    |    1     | 50000  |
| 4        |   4/1/2014 |    1    |    4     | 25000  |
+----------+----------+---------+----------+--------+
```

The table `orders` holds the sales record information, salesperson and customer company are represented by **sales\_id** and **com\_id**.

**output**

```text
+------+
| name | 
+------+
| Amy  | 
| Mark | 
| Alex |
+------+
```

**Explanation**

According to order '3' and '4' in table `orders`, it is easy to tell only salesperson 'John' and 'Alex' have sales to company 'RED',  
so we need to output all the other **names** in table `salesperson`.

## Solution

### Details

1. Answer below does not work since it's possible that a sales person have done multiple transaction but only one of them is with `RED` company. It's better to first to filter out the target company.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT s.Name
FROM 
    salesperson AS s LEFT JOIN orders AS o
    ON s.sales_id = o.sales_id
    LEFT JOIN company AS c
    ON o.com_id = c.com_id
WHERE c.name != 'RED' OR c.name IS NULL;
```

### Answer

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT s.Name
FROM salesperson AS s
WHERE s.sales_id NOT IN (
                            SELECT sales_id FROM orders 
                            WHERE com_id IN (
                                                SELECT com_id FROM company 
                                                WHERE name = 'RED'
                                            )
                        )
```
