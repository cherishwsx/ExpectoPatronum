# 184. Department Highest Salary

See original page [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/department-highest-salary/).

## Problem

The `Employee` table holds all employees. Every employee has an Id, a salary, and there is also a column for the department Id.

```text
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| Id | Name  | Salary | DepartmentId |
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| 1  | Joe   | 70000  | 1            |
| 2  | Jim   | 90000  | 1            |
| 3  | Henry | 80000  | 2            |
| 4  | Sam   | 60000  | 2            |
| 5  | Max   | 90000  | 1            |
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
```

The `Department` table holds all departments of the company.

```text
+----+----------+
| Id | Name     |
+----+----------+
| 1  | IT       |
| 2  | Sales    |
+----+----------+
```

Write a SQL query to find employees who have the highest salary in each of the departments. For the above tables, your SQL query should return the following rows \(order of rows does not matter\).

```text
+------------+----------+--------+
| Department | Employee | Salary |
+------------+----------+--------+
| IT         | Max      | 90000  |
| IT         | Jim      | 90000  |
| Sales      | Henry    | 80000  |
+------------+----------+--------+
```

## Solution

### Details

1. 需要问的问题是：是否是所有的Employee都有DepartmentId?
2. 在一开始的时候我用的是left join，所以在没有Employee table上没有DepartmentId的人最后也会被return出来，我觉得这一点可以和面试官沟通是否需要作出这个result。但是leetcode上默认的是不用，所以只接受join的答案。

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="MS SQL Server" %}
```sql
WITH cte AS (
    SELECT *, RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY DepartmentId ORDER BY Salary desc) as rnk 
    FROM Employee
)
SELECT d.Name as Department, c.Name as Employee, c.Salary
FROM 
    cte as c join Department as d
    on c.DepartmentId = d.Id
WHERE rnk = 1;

```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}
