# 571. Find Median Given Frequency of Numbers

See original page [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-median-given-frequency-of-numbers/).

## Problem

The `Numbers` table keeps the value of number and its frequency.

```text
+----------+-------------+
|  Number  |  Frequency  |
+----------+-------------|
|  0       |  7          |
|  1       |  1          |
|  2       |  3          |
|  3       |  1          |
+----------+-------------+
```

In this table, the numbers are `0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3`, so the median is `(0 + 0) / 2 = 0`.

```text
+--------+
| median |
+--------|
| 0.0000 |
+--------+
```

Write a query to find the median of all numbers and name the result as `median`.

## Solution

### Details

1. The answer below is from [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-median-given-frequency-of-numbers/discuss/102710/Easy-peasy).
2. The idea is using the definition of median. If the number is median, then the number on its left hand side is equal to the number on its right hand side. If it's not equal, then you want to make sure that the frequency of this number can cover the difference.

### Answer

```sql
SELECT AVG(n.Number) AS median
FROM Numbers AS n
WHERE n.Frequency >= ABS((SELECT SUM(Frequency) FROM Numbers WHERE Number <= n.Number) -
                         (SELECT SUM(Frequency) FROM Numbers WHERE Number >= n.Number));

```
