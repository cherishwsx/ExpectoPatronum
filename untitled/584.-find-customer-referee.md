# 584. Find Customer Referee

See original page [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-customer-referee/).

## Problem

Given a table `customer` holding customers information and the referee.

```text
+------+------+-----------+
| id   | name | referee_id|
+------+------+-----------+
|    1 | Will |      NULL |
|    2 | Jane |      NULL |
|    3 | Alex |         2 |
|    4 | Bill |      NULL |
|    5 | Zack |         1 |
|    6 | Mark |         2 |
+------+------+-----------+
```

Write a query to return the list of customers **NOT** referred by the person with id '2'.

For the sample data above, the result is:

```text
+------+
| name |
+------+
| Will |
| Jane |
| Bill |
| Zack |
+------+
```

## Solution

### Details

1. Notice that `referee_id != 2` will not include those will `NULL` referee\_id. So you have to think about it if it the table contains the `NULL` referee.

### Answer

```sql
SELECT name
FROM customer
WHERE referee_id != 2 or referee_id IS NULL;
```
