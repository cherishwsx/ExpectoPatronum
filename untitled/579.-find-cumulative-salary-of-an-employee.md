# 579. Find Cumulative Salary of an Employee

See original page [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-cumulative-salary-of-an-employee/).

## Problem

The **Employee** table holds the salary information in a year.

Write a SQL to get the cumulative sum of an employee's salary over a period of 3 months but exclude the most recent month.

The result should be displayed by 'Id' ascending, and then by 'Month' descending.

**Example**  
**Input**

```text
| Id | Month | Salary |
|----|-------|--------|
| 1  | 1     | 20     |
| 2  | 1     | 20     |
| 1  | 2     | 30     |
| 2  | 2     | 30     |
| 3  | 2     | 40     |
| 1  | 3     | 40     |
| 3  | 3     | 60     |
| 1  | 4     | 60     |
| 3  | 4     | 70     |
```

**Output**

```text

| Id | Month | Salary |
|----|-------|--------|
| 1  | 3     | 90     |
| 1  | 2     | 50     |
| 1  | 1     | 20     |
| 2  | 1     | 20     |
| 3  | 3     | 100    |
| 3  | 2     | 40     |
```

 **Explanation**

Employee '1' has 3 salary records for the following 3 months except the most recent month '4': salary 40 for month '3', 30 for month '2' and 20 for month '1'  
So the cumulative sum of salary of this employee over 3 months is 90\(40+30+20\), 50\(30+20\) and 20 respectively.

```text
| Id | Month | Salary |
|----|-------|--------|
| 1  | 3     | 90     |
| 1  | 2     | 50     |
| 1  | 1     | 20     |
```

Employee '2' only has one salary record \(month '1'\) except its most recent month '2'.

```text
| Id | Month | Salary |
|----|-------|--------|
| 2  | 1     | 20     |
```

 Employ '3' has two salary records except its most recent pay month '4': month '3' with 60 and month '2' with 40. So the cumulative salary is as following.

```text
| Id | Month | Salary |
|----|-------|--------|
| 3  | 3     | 100    |
| 3  | 2     | 40     |
```

## Solution

### Details

1. I think answer below should work in newest version of MySQL. Notice that MS SQL Server does not support `(a.b) in (...)` in where condition as far as I know.  But MySQL and PostgreSQL should work.
2. Using only join is way faster than the window function. Generally speaking, window function is slower. So it's really a trade off of using it.

```sql
SELECT Id, 
       Month,
       SUM(Salary) OVER(PARTITION BY Id ORDER BY MONTH ASC ROWS BETWEEN unbounded preceding AND CURRENT ROW) AS Salary
FROM Employee
WHERE (Id, Month) NOT IN (
                        SELECT Id, Max(Month) 
                        FROM Employee
                        GROUP BY 1
                     )
ORDER BY Id ASC, Month DESC;
```



### Answer

Join

```sql
SELECT
    a.id, 
    a.month,
    SUM(b.salary) AS Salary
FROM
    Employee AS a LEFT JOIN Employee AS b ON
    a.id = b.id AND
    a.month - b.month >= 0 AND
    a.month - b.month < 3
GROUP BY a.id, a.month
HAVING
    (a.id, a.month) NOT IN (SELECT id, MAX(month) FROM Employee GROUP BY id)
ORDER BY a.id, a.month DESC
```

Window Function

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="MS SQL Server" %}
```sql
WITH CTE AS (
    SELECT *, 
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY Id ORDER BY Month DESC) AS rn
    FROM Employee
)
SELECT Id, 
       Month,
       SUM(Salary) OVER(PARTITION BY Id ORDER BY MONTH ASC ROWS BETWEEN 2 preceding AND CURRENT ROW) AS Salary
FROM CTE
WHERE rn != 1
ORDER BY Id ASC, Month DESC;
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}
